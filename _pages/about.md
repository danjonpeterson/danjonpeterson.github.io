* White matter degnereration in Alzheimer's disease  
* Atypical dementias (FTD, PSP, CBD)  
* Diffusion methodology - improving image processing  
* Temporal lobe epilepsy  
* Automated segmentation of spinal cord diffusion images  
* 3D printing of model brains from an MRI scan  

Past Projects
======
* Diffusion imaging in Autism  
* Diffusion imaging in ADHD: Differences between boys and girls  
* White matter connectivity in dyslexia  
* Experiment development for solution-state NMR
