I participated in Brain Awareness week and tabled for the UW Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). There's a great writeup by Genevieve Wanucha here: [**http://depts.washington.edu/mbwc/news/article/brain-awareness-week-at-uw**](http://depts.washington.edu/mbwc/news/article/brain-awareness-week-at-uw)
